# Julia-Soilspec
A Julia version of the R soilspec package (tools for soil spectral inference).

The majority of the utilities and data here based on the R [soilspec](https://github.com/AlexandreWadoux/soilspec) package. That package itself is a companion to the textbook "Soil Spectral Inference with R" (by Wadoux, A. M. J. C., et al., Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany: Springer, 2021).

**This repository is under construction.**
