# Title:       cssfunction
#
# Description: Assesses the adequate calibration set size for infrared
#              spectroscopy.
#
# Parameters:
#   S            A matrix of the scores of the principal components.
#   k            A vector containing the sample set sizes to be evaluated.
#   method       The sampling algorithm. Options are:
#                - "kss" (Kennard-Stone Sampling),
#                - "kms" (K-Means Sampling), the default,
#                - "clhs" (Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling).
#   repetitions  The number of times that the sampling must be carried out for
#                for each sample size to be evaluated. The results of the
#                final msd is the average of the ones obtained at each
#                iteration. Note that since the "kss" method is deterministic
#                and always returns the same results, there is no need for
#                repetitions.
#   n            The number of equally spaced points at which the probability
#                densities are to be estimated (see the density function of the
#                R package, stats).
#   from, to     A vector of the left and right-most points of the grid at which
#                the densities are to be estimated. Default is the minimums and
#                maximums of the variables in S.
#   bw           A vector containing the the smoothing bandwidth to be use for
#                the probability densities (see density function of the package
#                stats).
#   ...          Arguments to be passed to the calibration sampling algorithms,
#                i.e. additional aruments to be used for the clhs, kenStone or
#                naes functions which run inside this function.
#
# Info:        A function for assessing the adequate calibration set size for
#              - Kennard-Stone Sampling,
#              - K-Means Sampling,
#              - Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling.
#
#              This function works by comparing the probability density function
#              (pdf) of the population and the pdf of the sample set in order to
#              assess the representativeness of the sample set. See
#              Ramirez-Lopez et al. (2014) for more details.
#
# Returns:     A table with the following columns
#              - css: the sample set size (k),
#              - msd,
#              - msd_sd: the standard deviation of the msd for all the
#                        repetitions (doesn't apply to "kss" since it always
#                        returns the same results).
